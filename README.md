# NLP - MultinomialNB : TripAdvisor Online Hotel Review Text Classification


## About
This project is an extension of another one of my projects I did in my Intro to Data Science class. This project is an example of using Natural Language Processing as it utilizes Mutlinomia Naive Bayes model to predicit the rating of a hotel review by using text tokens. The preliminary dataset is a sample data of Trip Advisor's Hotel reviews and their ratings. The trained model will be used to predict if a new set of reviews are positive or negative.
